# 2019-20 NHL Key Statistics Tableau Dashboard
### An interactive Tableau dashboard with key offensive, defensive, and team level statistics for the 2019-20 NHL Hockey Season. 

I decided to take advantage of the time off during quarantine to learn new methods and applications for the manipulation and presentation of all types of data. Fortunately for me, Tableau was generous enough to make their entire e-learning platform free for a limited time so I decided to take full advantage and complete the Tableau Data Analyst course using Tableau Public (the professional service is just way too expensive for casual at-home use). Tableau is truly an incredibly powerful and customizable experience for exploring and crafting meaningful data insights.

The large majority of my data projects revolve around financial economics and business data, but with the NHL season FINALLY planning to restart, I wanted to add some diversification to my research and what better way than to focus on the best sport known to man, NHL hockey (not that I’m biased because I’ve played the game since I could walk…but I am completely biased). My first dashboard contained only a breakdown of offensive statistics, making use of a singular dashboard, four or five worksheets, and only a few dashboard actions. But, as any data explorer knows, there is always more information to convey.

The final product is my first ever complete Tableau publication. This dashboard is actually comprised of three separate dashboards, the original offensive breakdown for individual players, a defensive breakdown for individual players, and a team-level comparison for team-level statistics. I utilized many more dashboards, parameter actions for dynamic visualizations, and custom functions to produce an interactive in-depth look at where the players currently stand (or skate…haha), statistically speaking, before the NHL resumes for the playoffs in August. Unfortunately, there isn’t currently a way to embed a tableau dash into Medium, but the dashboard can be found at this link:

If you do happen to play around with it, please feel free to comment with any comments, recommendations, things you love, things you hate, things you ate for breakfast, etc. This is my first full product on Tableau and the only way to get better is to identify where I need to get better!
